<p>The survey looked at 14,216 people in Brazil between the ages of 35 to 74. A food frequency questionnaire was used to determine whether people followed a meatless diet.</p>

<p>A diagnostic tool called the Clinical Interview Schedule-Revised (CIS-R) was used to determine whether people had episodes of depression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The researchers found, upon analysis of the data, that meatless diets were associated with twice the frequency of depressive episodes. Further, this association was independent of socioeconomic factors as well as lifestyle factors like smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity levels, and body mass index (BMI). The exact reason for these findings is unclear.</p>

<p><a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting/mary-mosquera" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mary Mosquera-Cochran</a>, a registered dietitian at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center who was not a part of the study, said that due to the way the study was designed — analyzing data rather than conducting a controlled experiment — it can’t be concluded whether a meatless diet actually does cause depression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The researchers found that diet quality was somewhat associated with higher rates of depression, but it did not fully explain the association,” said Cochran.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She further explained that the researchers hypothesized that this link might exist because people who are depressed are more likely to try dietary changes (like cutting out meat, for example) because they are hoping to feel better.</p>

<p>Cochran said that the study was done on Brazilian citizens, so it also may not apply to other populations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She additionally pointed out the fact that it was only a very small percentage of people in the sample studied were actually vegetarians — 82 people out of around 14,000 total.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The authors note that it’s currently estimated that 5-14% of Brazilians currently follow a vegetarian style diet, so this sample may not be reflective of all vegetarians in Brazil either,” said Cochran.</p>
